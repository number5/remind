HTML Calendar Server

This is a rudimentary calendar server for the WWW.  It supplies local
sunrise and sunset times, moon phases, upcoming Jewish holidays, and
PostScript calendars.  It only works under UNIX/Linux.  I've only tested it
with Linux running Apache's httpd, but it should work on any UNIX/Linx web
server that supports CGI scripts.

To install it, you need the Remind package, available from
https://dianne.skoll.ca/projects/remind/ You should install Remind,
setting the latitude, longitude, location and time zone as appropriate
for your machine.

Once you have Remind installed, follow these steps to set up your WWW
server:

1) Edit the Makefile in this directory.  See the comments in the Makefile
   for details.

2) Make sure "rem2html" is installed.

3) Type "make install"

4) Test it out.  It will generate links of the form:

	http://www.your_server.com/your_cgi-bin/cal_dispatch?what

where "what" is one of:
	sunrise -- show info about sunrise times.
	sunset  -- show info about sunset times.
	hebdate -- show today's Hebrew date.
	calps   -- get a blank PostScript calendar.
	moon    -- show info about moon phases.
	hebps   -- get a PostScript calendar with Jewish holidays.
	hebhtml -- get an HTML version of the above (requires Perl.)

   All of these links will be set up in a sample HTML document
   called "calendar.html" and installed in the HTMLDIR you specified
   in the Makefile.

5) Enjoy!
