This directory contains holiday files.  The two-character files contain
holidays for various countries.  Some countries (such as US and CA) have
regions with their own different holidays; the regional holidays are
stored in *.rem files underneath the country-code directory (eg, us and ca,
respectively.)

Many of these files were generated from the excellent "holidays" Python
library at https://pypi.org/project/holidays/

I did great damage to the library and host a terrible, awful hacked version
at https://github.com/dfskoll/holidays; it is this repo (in the remind-output
branch) that I used to generate the Remind files.

***** NOTE *****: Any holidays that depend on a non-Gregorian calendar
such as Jewish, Islamic, Chinese and other East Asian calendars will
NOT appear in the country files!  The only exceptions are holidays
depending on the Orthodox Easter date, for which Remind has support.

Non-country holiday files are:

chinese-new-year.rem - Chinese New Year from 2022 through 2050
discordian.rem       - Discordian holidays
jewish.rem           - Jewish holidays
pagan.rem            - Pagan holidays
