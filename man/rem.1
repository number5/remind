rem \- Invoke Remind with a default filename
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B rem [\fIoptions\fR] [\fIdate\fR] [\fI*rep\fR] [\fItime\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBrem\fR is a symbolic link to \fBremind\fR.  When \fBremind\fR
determines that it has been invoked as \fBrem\fR, it uses a default
filename rather than expecting a filename to be supplied on the command
line.
.PP
If the environment variable DOTREMINDERS is set, \fBremind\fR uses the
value of DOTREMINDERS as the filename.  Otherwise, \fBremind\fR uses
the filename $HOME/.reminders
