REM2HTML
--------

rem2html is a Perl script that transforms the output of `remind -pp
...' to HTML.  Type `perl rem2html --help' for usage information.

rem2html requires the Perl modules `JSON::MaybeXS' and `Getopt::Long'.  It
will not be installed unless you have those modules as well as Perl
itself.
