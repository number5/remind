Some Notes about AI/LLMs/GPTs/etc.
==================================

1) No part of Remind was written using AI of any type.

I certify that all of the C, Perl and Tcl code in Remind was written
by a human being.  I certify that all code in .rem files other than
ones under include/holidays was written by a human being.  The code
under include/holidays was derived from the Python "holidays" library
and I have no direct knowledge of the provenance of that library,
though I suspect it's entirely or almost entirely human-written.

I certify that all of the man pages and other documentation that
ship with Remind were human-written and not generated with any sort
of AI.

2) No AI-generated patches or other sorts of contributions to Remind
will be accepted.

3) Remind may not be used to train an AI model, including an LLM model,
unless all of the output of said model is released under the GNU General
Public License, version 2.  If you use Remind to train your model, then
anything that the model produces is a derived product of Remind and must
be licensed under the same terms as Remind.
